Inside of each block:

	if version 5:
	
		8 bits - nonzero indicates the presence of uncompressed samples at the end of the granule 
	
	if version 6 or 7 (CHECK):
	
		1 bit - there is an extended header
		1 bit - unknown
		2 bits - unused
		12 bits - total granule size including this small header and uncompressed samples
		
		if extended header:
		
			2 bits - mode
			10 bits - sample frames to discard (mode == 0) or skip (mode == 1 or 2) before outputting the uncompressed samples (CHECK!)
			10 bits - number of uncompressed sample frames at the end of the granule
			10 bits - granule size (can be zero)
	
	all versions:
	
		2 bits - MPEG version
		2 bits - MPEG sample rate index
		2 bits - MPEG channel mode
		2 bits - MPEG mode extension
		1 bit - which granule
		
		if granule is 1 and version is 3 (MPEG 1.0):
		
			channels * 4 bits - MPEG scfsi
			
		MPEG side info beginning after scfsi for each channel
		MPEG data
		
	if version 5 and there are uncompressed samples:
	
		32 bits - number of uncompressed sample frames
		32 bits - offset in the outputted granule these samples go (CHECK)
		channels * uncompressed * 16 bits - uncompressed PCM samples
	
	if version 6 or 7 and there are uncompressed samples:
	
		channels * uncompressed * 16 bits - uncompressed PCM samples


That was one granule. No go back to the beginning!
