AB00CCCC CCCCCCCC  if A is set:  DDEEEEEE EEEEFFFF FFFFFFGG GGGGGGGG

A = whether or not the second 4 bytes must be read from the file
B = ???? B + 1 is what's stored, not used by program though
C = total granule size in bytes (including these 2 or 6 bytes and uncompressed samples)
D = mode:
E = bytes to discard (mode == 0) or skip (mode == 1 or 2) before outputting the uncompressed samples
	(when mode == 3 this is ignored)
F = number of uncompressed sample frames
G = MPEG granule size (can be zero)



	if 0: 576 - E if G == 0 then F
	if 1: 576 if G == 0 then F
	if 2: 576 if G == 0 then F * 2
	if 3: 576
